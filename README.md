# E-Commerce Flutter App

A Flutter project showcasing the implementation of the BLoC pattern for state management and adhering to Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture principles.

## Description

This project serves as a foundation for developing a robust and scalable E-Commerce mobile application using Flutter. It utilizes the following key technologies:

- **Flutter Bloc:** A predictable state management library that helps to manage and organize the application's state in a clear and maintainable way.

- **Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture:** The project follows the principles of clean architecture, separating concerns into distinct layers (presentation, domain, and data), making the codebase modular and easier to maintain.

- **Dependency Injection (DI):** Leveraging GetIt for dependency injection, allowing for better organization and testability of code.

- **Freezed:** Used for generating immutable data models with minimal boilerplate code.



- **Cached Network Image:** Efficiently loads and caches network images for a smooth user experience.
